                    ICMIC invites the submissions of original, unpublished research works that are currently not under review. Authors can submit a 1 or 2-page Work-in-Process (WIP) papers. Through Work-in-Progress papers, authors can share latest results with the research community. WIP papers emphasize the novelty of the work, not completeness. All submissions should be in PDF format, formatted with single-spaced, two-column pages using at least 10 pt (or higher) size fonts on A4 or letter pages following the standard IEEE conference templates.

            <div>
                <div class="inner">
                    All camera-ready submissions must be submitted electronically, in PDF format, and uploaded on EDAS. The
                    final camera-ready manuscript of your paper should account for all the critical reviewers’ feedback. The
                    maximum paper length is 2 pages, and papers exceeding 6 pages will not be accepted by EDAS. Proofread
                    your source document thoroughly as there will be no possibility for further revision.
                    All camera-ready manuscript submissions MUST be formatted with the standard IEEE conference templates
                    and MUST be validated by IEEE PDF eXpress. The IEEE Copyright should be submitted from EDAS as well.
                    Furthermore, in order for your paper(s) to be published in the ICMIC 2022 Conference Proceedings and
                    IEEE
                    Xplore, an author (including students) of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference
                    at the Full rate and must present the paper at the conference.
                    Once you have completed the preparation of your final manuscript, IEEE PDF eXpress validation, copyright
                    submission, and registration, you can upload your final manuscript in EDAS. In the EDAS page of your
                    paper, select the “Final Manuscript” button and follow the instructions to upload the PDF file with the
                    final manuscript of your paper that has been previously obtained from PDF.

                <div class="inner2">
                    Prior to submission, the final manuscript PDF file must be validated by IEEE PDF eXpress to ensure
                    that it is IEEE Xplore-compliant.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Go to <a href="https://ieee-pdf-express.org/" target="_blank">IEEE PDF eXpress</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you are a new user, select 'New Users - Click here' and enter the Conference ID (see
                            below), your email address and choose a password. If you have used previously PDF eXpress
                            you should enter the same password that was used for previous conference.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                    <div>
                        Once inside PDF eXpress you have two options:
                    </div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Option 1 (recommended): You can generate the PDF file from your source files (e.g. MS Word)
                            and the generated PDF file will be IEEE Xplore-compliant. For executing this option, you
                            have to select “Create New Title”, introduce the title of the paper, and then upload the
                            source files. Once the file is converted, download it. This will be the final manuscript
                            file that you will have to upload later on in EDAS.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Option 2: You can validate a PDF file generated previously with any other tool. If you
                            choose this option, please make sure that all the fonts are embedded, there are no bookmarks
                            and no links (URLs). For executing this option, you have to select “Create New Title”,
                            introduce the title of the paper, and then upload your PDF file. Once the status of the file
                            indicates “PDF Passed PDF check; PDF is IEEE Xplore compatible”, download it from PDF
                            eXpress. This will be the final manuscript file that you will have to upload later on in
                            EDAS (please note that EDAS will not allow you to upload the initial PDF file, but the
                            validated and certified file that you download from PDF eXpress).

                        Please login to your EDAS account and look for your ICMIC 2022 accepted paper under
