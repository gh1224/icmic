                    The International Conference on Maritime IT Convergence (ICMIC) will be inaugurated in 2022 with
                    aims to promote convergence activities of maritime and terrestrial communications as well as related
                    wireless communications. Recognizing that maritime communications will usually involve ship-to-ship
                    and ship-to-shore communication, maritime ICT technologies will bring some mature but still evolving
                    terrestrial wired/wireless communication technologies to its own use for future smart maritime
                    communications. More specifically, the conference will focus on addressing challenges of maritime
                    communications with ICT convergence or advanced wireless communications over various industrial
                    sectors, academia and practice engineers. The conference will include keynote speech sessions,
                    invited special sessions and technical paper sessions.
